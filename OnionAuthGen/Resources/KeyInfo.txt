The .onion operator **never** needs your private key file or the data it contains.
Handing over this data is a security risk.
If you want to reuse an existing file for another onion service (not recommended),
use the "Private Keys" tab to duplicate a key and change the .onion name of it.

It's generally better to create a new key file for each onion service you want to access.
Using the same file for multiple services allows those operators to know that you're the same person.
