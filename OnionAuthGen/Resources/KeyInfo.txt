The .onion operator never needs your private key file or the data it contains.
Handing over this data is a security risk.
If you want to reuse an existing file for another onion service (not recommended), follow these steps:

- Import your private key file
- Change the file name box
- Edit the onion name text box with the new name and confirm the changes
- Save the private key file with the new name.
- Copy the *server side* value and send to the .onion operator

It's generally better to create a new key file for each onion service you want to access.
Using the same file for multiple services allows those operators to know that you're the same person.
