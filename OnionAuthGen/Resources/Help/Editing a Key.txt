You can edit the onion name of a key. This is useful if the .onion name of a service changed.

1. Import the key you want to change
2. Put a new name into the onion name box
3. Confirm the prompt
4. Save the client key.

If you no longer need the old onion name, you can overwrite the existing key, otherwise use a new file name.

Note: You can also use this to quickly duplicate your key to use it for a different onion service.
In general, this is not recommended though.
