A key consists of a public and a private part.
To not confuse users too much, these are referred as server key and client key in this application.

Server key
==========
The server key is held by the .onion operator.
It's not considered secret information and it's generally not a problem if someone manages to steal the key
because they can't pretend to be the client with this key.
However, you may still want to consider sending the server admin a new key if this happens.

Client key
==========
The client key is held by the .onion visitor.
You never want to share this key with anybody. Anyone who gets his hands on the key can pretend to be you.
You should generally be suspicious if the server admin gives you a key to access a .onion site.
It should be the other way where you generate a key and hand over the server part to the server admin.

Because this key is sensitive, the client configuration is not shown by default,
but an option is provided to unmask the text box and show the configuration line.

Tor configuration
==========
If you use a manual Tor installation, you need to configure it to handle your client keys.
Once you save a client key, the matching configuration line is show below the client key line.
You simply add this line to your tor configuration and restart Tor.
Note: Tor will only scan for keys when it starts. If you add/modify/delete keys you need to restart Tor for the changes to apply.

Tor Browser
==========
Tor browser doesn't requires any configuration.
If you visit a protected .onion site, you will be prompted to enter your client key.
Simply click the "Copy key" button and paste the key into the Tor browser dialog.
