About Keys

A key consists of a public and a private part.

Public Key
==========
The public key is held by the .onion operator.
It's not considered secret information and it's generally not a problem if someone manages to steal the key
because they can't pretend to be the client with this key.
However, you may still want to consider sending the server admin a new key if this happens.

Private Key
===========
The private key is held by the .onion visitor.
You never want to share this key with anybody. Anyone who gets his hands on the key can pretend to be you.
You should generally be suspicious if the server admin gives you a key to access a .onion site.
It should be the other way where you generate a key and hand over the public part to the server admin.

Because this key is sensitive, the client configuration is not shown by default,
but an option is provided to unmask the text box and show the configuration line.

Tor configuration
=================
If you use a manual Tor installation, you need to configure it to handle your private keys.
Once you save a private key, the matching configuration line is show below the private key line.
You simply add this line to your tor configuration and restart Tor.
Note: Tor will only scan for keys when it starts.
If you add/modify/delete keys you need to restart Tor for the changes to apply.

Tor Browser
===========
Tor browser doesn't requires any configuration.
If you visit a protected .onion site, you will be prompted to enter your private key.
Simply click the appropriate "Copy key" button in the key generator and paste the key into the Tor browser dialog.
