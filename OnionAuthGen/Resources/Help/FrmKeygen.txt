Key generator form

This window allows you to generate keys.
Multiple types are offered:

1. Random key:

This is the preferred way if you trust this computer and have a safe way of storing the key.
A cryptographically safe random number generator is used.

2. Deterministic key

This derives a key from a passphrase you provide.
An option to use 6 randomly chosen words from an english word list is provided below the text box.
The key number field allows you to generate different keys with the same passphrase.
Note that it's generally recommended to use different passphrases to get different keys.

Note that all three values (passphrase, key number, difficulty checkbox) must be identical to generate the same key again later.

3. User designed key

This is mostly intended as a fun toy and you should prefer deterministic keys rather than designed keys.
