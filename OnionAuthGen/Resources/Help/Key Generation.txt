This application can be used to generate brand new keys.

Be careful when using this function multiple times.
The application won't keep a history of generated keys. Any key generated but not saved is lost.

Note: You only need to save the client side of the key.
The server side will be automatically regenerated when importing a client key.
This does not work the other way! You can recreate the server key from the client key,
but not the client key from the server key.
