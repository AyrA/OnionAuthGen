Key Generator

This application can be used to generate brand new keys.

Be careful when using this function multiple times.
The application won't keep a history of generated keys. Any key generated but not saved is lost.

Note: You only need to save the private key.
The public key will be automatically regenerated when importing a private key.
This does not work the other way! You can recreate the public key from the private key,
but not the private key from the public key.
