As a server administrator, you can use this tool to generate keys for your users.

Note that this is not an ideal process.
For better security, the user should generate the keys and send you the public key part.
As a .onion operator you ideally would never see the private key.

To use this as a server operator:

1. Generate a new key pair
2. Save the server side part into your onion service directory
3. Restart Tor
4. Send the client side string to the client.

Note: Do not send the client side part over an insecure channel.
