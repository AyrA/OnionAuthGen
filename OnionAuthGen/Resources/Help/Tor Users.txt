As a Tor user, you can use this tool to generate keys to access a secured .onion service.

The procedure is really simple:

1. Fill in the .onion name text box
2. Click "Generate new keypair"
3. Click the "Save" button next to the client configuration line and save the key to your computer.
4. Click the "Copy" button next to the server configuration line
5. Send the copied line to the .onion administrator.

For more details on how to use your client key, see the "Keys" help.
