Tor Users

As a Tor user, you can use this tool to generate keys to access a secured .onion service.
The procedure is really simple:

1. Hit CTRL+N or use the appropriate entry in the file menu.
2. Save the private key
3. Click the "Copy" button next to the server configuration line
5. Send the copied line to the .onion administrator.

For more details on how to use your private key, see the "Keys" help.
