Main Form: Public Keys

The public key tab allows you to manage public keys for an onion service.
Any key in this list that is enabled is granted access to your onion.
Everyone is granted access if all keys are either disabled or removed.
Use the context menu to perform various actions, including:

- Renaming keys
- Copying the public key configuration or just the key itself
- Enable/Disable keys
- Deleting keys
